# DestVI-reproducibility
This repository contains the code to reproduce the analyses performed in the DestVI manuscript.

The code here requires the versions of the packages specified in the requirements.txt file. We may update the API of the scvi-tools package so not all code is guaranteed to work with the latest version of that package.

We also host the data used in the manuscript in the AnnData format here.
